## Coding Standards for R

1. Always yse text files / text editor
2. Indent your code
3. Limit the width of your code to 80 characters
4. Limit the length of individual functions
   1. easy to read and for debugging

## Markdown

"Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)."

### Markdown Syntax

#### Headers

```markdown
# This is an h1 tag
## This is an h2 tag
###### This is an h6 tag
```

#### Emphasis

```markdown
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

*You **can** combine them*
```

#### Lists

##### Unordered

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

##### Ordered

```markdown
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

#### Images

```markdown
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
```

#### Links

```markdown
http://github.com - automatic!
[GitHub](http://github.com)
```

#### Blockquotes

```markdown
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.
```

## R Markdown

What is Markdown?
· Created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz
· A simplified version of "markup" languages
· Allows one to focus on writing as opposed to formatting
· Simple/minimal intuitive formatting elements
· Easily converted to valid HTML (and other formats) using existing tools
· Complete information is available at http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
· Some background information at http://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive_into_markdown

### What is R Markdown?

· R markdown is the integration of R code with markdown
· Allows one to create documents containing "live" R code
· R code is evaluated as part of the processing of the markdown
· Results from R code are inserted into Markdown document
· A core tool in literate statistical programming


· R markdown can be converted to standard markdown using the knitr package in R
· Markdown can be converted to HTML using the markdown package in R
· Any basic text editor can be used to create a Markdown document; no special editing tools needed
· The R markdown --> markdown --> HTML work flow can be easily managed using R Studio (but not required)
· These slides were written in R markdown and converted to slides using the slidify package


## Literal Statistical Programming with Knitr


### Problems, Problems


•  Authors must undertake considerable effort to put data/results on the web
•  Readers must download data/results individually and piece together which data go with which code sec)ons, etc.
•  Authors/readers must manually interact with websites
•  There is no single document to integrate data analysis with textual representa)ons; i.e. data, code, and text are not linked

### Literate Sta)s)cal Programming

•  Original idea comes from Don Knuth
•  An ar)cle is a stream of text and code
•  Analysis code is divided into text and code “chunks”
•  Presenta)on code formats results (tables, figures, etc.)
•  Ar)cle text explains what is going on
•  Literate programs are weaved to produce human- readable documents and tangled to produce machine- readable documents

### Literate Sta)s)cal Programming with R

•  Literate programming is a general concept. We need
–  A documenta)on language –  A programming language
•  The original Sweave system developed by Friedrich Leisch used LaTeX and R
•  knitr supports a variety of documenta)on languages

### How Do I Make My Work Reproducible?

•  Decide to do it (ideally from the start)
•  Keep track of things, perhaps with a version control system to track snapshots/changes
•  Use soVware whose opera)on can be coded
•  Don’t save output
•  Save data in non-proprietary formats


### Literate Programming: Pros

•  Text and code all in one place, logical order
•  Data, results automa)cally updated to reflect external changes
•  Code is live--automa)c “regression test” when building a document


### Literate Programming: Cons

•  Text and code all in one place; can make documents difficult to read, especially if there is a lot of code
•  Can substan)ally slow down processing of documents (although there are tools to help)

### What is knitr?

•  An R package wri\en by Yihui Xie (while he was a grad student at Iowa State)
–  Available on CRAN
•  Supports RMarkdown, LaTeX, and HTML as
document)on languages
•  Can export to PDF, HTML
•  Built right into RStudio for your convenience

### Requirements

•  A recent version of R
•  A text editor (the one that comes with RStudio is okay)
•  Some support packages also available on CRAN
•  Some knowledge of Markdown, LaTeX, or HTML
•  We will use Markdown here

### Processing of knitr Documents

•  knitr processes a document in two steps
–  Code chunks are executed and output is saved
–  Output is inserted into the document
•  This is done in a single step in RStudio

rmarkdown --> knitr --> markdown --> HTML

The current time is `r time` and my favorite number is `r round(pi, 2)`.


## Caching the Results of Code Chunks

•  Code chunks are executed every time the document is compiled
•  This can be very slow if the code takes a long time to run
•  knitr can cache the results of code chunks
•  The cache is invalidated if the code or data change
•  Cache is stored in a database in a hidden directory
•  Cache can be manually deleted if needed
