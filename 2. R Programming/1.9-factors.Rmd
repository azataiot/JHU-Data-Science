## Factors

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be *unordered or ordered*. One can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has a label.

- Factors are treated specially by modelling functions like lm() and glm()    

- Using factors with labels is better than using integers because factors are self-describing; having
a variable that has values “Male” and “Female” is better than a variable that has values 1 and 2.   

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
x
```
```{r}
table(x)
```
```{r}
unclass(x)
```

The order of the levels can be set using the levels argument to factor(). This can be important in linear modelling because the first level is used as the baseline level.

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"), levels = c("yes", "no"))
x
```
