# Missing Values

Missing values are denoted by NA or NaN for undefined mathematical operations.

- is.na() is used to test objects if they are NA

- is.nan() is used to test for NaN

- NA values have a class also, so there are integer NA, character NA, etc.

- A NaN value is also NA but the converse is not true


```{r}
x<-c(1,2,NA,10,3)
is.na(x)
```

```{r}
is.nan(x)
```
```{r}
x<-c(1,2,NaN,NA,4)
is.na(x)
```

```{r}
is.nan(x)
```

	1.	NA: This stands for “Not Available”. NA is used when the value of a variable is unknown or missing in general. It can be used for any data type in R, including logical, integer, real, complex, character, and raw.
	2.	NaN: This stands for “Not a Number”. NaN is a special value that is primarily used in numerical computations. It’s the result of an undefined mathematical operation. For example, 0/0 or Inf - Inf in R will give you NaN.
