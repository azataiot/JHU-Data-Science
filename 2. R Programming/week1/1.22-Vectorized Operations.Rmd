# Vectorized Operations

Many operations in R are vectorized making code more efficient, concise, and easier to read.

```{r}
x<-1:4;y<-6:9
x
y
```
```{r}
x+y
```

```{r}
x>2
```

```{r}
y ==8 
```
```{r}
x*y
```
```{r}
x/y
```

## Vectorized Matrix Operations

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2); y <- matrix(rep(10, 4), 2, 2)
x
```

```{r}
y
```
```{r}
x * y ## element-wise multiplication
```
```{r}
x/y
```
```{r}
x %*% y ## true matrix multiplication
```
