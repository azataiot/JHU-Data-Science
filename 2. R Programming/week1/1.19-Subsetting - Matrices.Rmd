# Subsetting - Matrices

Matrices can be subsetted in the usual way with (i,j) type indices.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x
```

```{r}
x[1, 2] # first row second element
```
```{r}
x[2, 1] # second row first element
```

Indices can also be missing.

```{r}
x[1,] # all elements from the first row
```
```{r}
x[,2] # all elements from the second column
```

By default, when a single element of a matrix is retrieved, it is returned as a vector of length 1 rather than a 1 Ã— 1 matrix. This behavior can be turned off by setting drop = FALSE.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x
```


```{r}
x[1, 2]
```

```{r}
x[1, 2, drop=FALSE]
```

Similarly, subsetting a single column or a single row will give you a vector, not a matrix (by default).

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x
```
```{r}
x[1,]
```
```{r}
x[1, drop=F]
```
