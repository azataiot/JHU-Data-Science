# Names

R objects can also have names, which is very useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects. 

```{r}
x<-1:3
names(x)
```

```{r}
names(x) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")
x
```
```{r}
names(x)
```

Lists can also have names.

```{r}
x<-list(a=1,b=2,c=3)
x
```


And matrices.

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m
```
```{r}
dimnames(m) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d"))
m
```
