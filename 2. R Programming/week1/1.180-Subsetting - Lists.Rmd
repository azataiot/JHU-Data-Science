# Subsetting - Lists


```{r}
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6)
x
```
```{r}
x[1]
```
```{r}
x$bar
```
```{r}
x[["bar"]]
```
```{r}
x["bar"]
```
```{r}
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6, baz = "hello")
x
```

```{r}
x[c(1,3)]
```
The [[ operator can be used with computed indices; $ can only be used with literal names.

```{r}
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6, baz = "hello")
x
```
```{r}
name <- "foo"
x[[name]] ## computed index for ‘foo’
```
```{r}
x$name ## element ‘name’ doesn’t exist!
```
```{r}
 x$foo
```

[1] 1 2 3 4 ## element ‘foo’ does exist

The [[ can take an integer sequence.

```{r}
x <- list(a = list(10, 12, 14), b = c(3.14, 2.81))
x
```
```{r}
x[[c(1, 3)]] # third element from first object?
```
```{r}
x[[1]][[3]] # third element from first object>?
```

```{r}
x[[c(2, 1)]] # first element from the second object?
```
