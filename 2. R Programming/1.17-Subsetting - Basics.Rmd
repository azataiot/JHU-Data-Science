# Subsetting - Basics

## Subsetting



There are a number of operators that can be used to extract subsets of R objects.
· *[ always returns an object of the same class as the original*; can be used to select more than one element (there is one exception)
· *[[ is used to extract elements of a list or a data frame*; it can only be used to extract a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily be a list or data frame
· *$ is used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name*; semantics are similar to that of [[.

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")
x[1]
```
```{r}
x[2]
```
```{r}
x[1:4]
```
```{r}
x[x>"a"]
```

```{r}
u<-x>"a"
u
```
```{r}
x[u]
```
