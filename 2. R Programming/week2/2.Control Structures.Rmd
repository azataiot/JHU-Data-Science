# 2. Control Structures 



## Control Structures - Introduction

Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of execution of the program, depending on runtime conditions. Common structures are
· if, else: testing a condition
· for: execute a loop a fixed number of times
· while: execute a loop while a condition is true · repeat: execute an infinite loop
· break: break the execution of a loop
· next: skip an interation of a loop
· return: exit a function
Most control structures are not used in interactive sessions, but rather when writing functions or longer expresisons.

## Control Structures - If-else

```
if(<condition>) {
## do something
}else{
## do something else
} if(<condition1>) {
## do something
} else if(<condition2>) {
## do something different
}else{
## do something different
}
```
### if

This is a valid if/else structure.
```{r}
x <-0
```


```{r}
if(x>3) {
  y <- 10
} else{
  y <- 0
}
```

So is this one.

```{r}
y <- if (x > 3) {
  10
} else{
  0
}
```

Of course, the else clause is not necessary.

```
if(<condition1>) { 

}

if(<condition2>) {

}
```

## Control Structures - For loops

for loops take an interator variable and assign it successive values from a sequence or vector. For loops are most commonly used for iterating over the elements of an object (list, vector, etc.)

```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```

This loop takes the i variable and in each iteration of the loop gives it values 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, and then exits.

These three loops have the same behavior.

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

for (i in 1:4) {
  print(x[i])
}
```


```{r}
for(i in seq_along(x)) {
  print(x[i])
}
```

```{r}
for(letter in x) {
  print(letter)
}
```

```{r}
for(i in 1:4) print(x[i])
```

### Nested for loops

for loops can be nested.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
for (i in seq_len(nrow(x))) {
  for (j in seq_len(ncol(x))) {
    print(x[i, j])
  }
}
```

Be careful with nesting though. Nesting beyond 2–3 levels is often very difficult to read/understand.

## Control Structures - While loops


While loops begin by testing a condition. If it is true, then they execute the loop body. Once the loop body is executed, the condition is tested again, and so forth.

```{r}
count <- 0
while (count < 10) {
  print(count)
  count <- count + 1
}
```
While loops can potentially result in infinite loops if not written properly. Use with care!

Sometimes there will be more than one condition in the test.

```{r}
z <- 5
while (z >= 3 && z <= 10) {
  print(z)
  coin <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)
  if (coin == 1) {
    ## random walk z<-z+1
  } else{
    z <- z - 1
  }
}
```

Conditions are always evaluated from left to right.

## Control Structures - Repeat, Next, Break

### repeat

Repeat initiates an infinite loop; these are not commonly used in statistical applications but they do have their uses. The only way to exit a repeat loop is to call break.

```{r, error=TRUE}
x0 <- 1 
tol <- 1e-8
repeat {
  x1 <- computeEstimate()
  if (abs(x1 - x0) < tol) {
    break
  } else{
    x0 <- x1
  }
}
```
The loop in the previous slide is a bit dangerous because there’s no guarantee it will stop. Better to set a hard limit on the number of iterations (e.g. using a for loop) and then report whether convergence was achieved or not.

### next, return

next is used to skip an iteration of a loop

```{r}
for(i in 1:100) {
  if (i <= 20) {
    ## Skip the first 20 iterations
    next
  }
  ## Do something here
  print(i)
}
```

return signals that a function should exit and return a given value

### Control Structures

Summary
· Control structures like if, while, and for allow you to control the flow of an R program
· Infinite loops should generally be avoided, even if they are theoretically correct.
· Control structures mentiond here are primarily useful for writing programs; for command-line interactive work, the *apply functions are more useful.
